Ans:-
   
      No, HTML tags and elements are not the same thing, although they are closely related.

      -> HTML Tags:

      1. Tags are the markup characters that surround an HTML element and provide information about that element.
      2. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and typically come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag.

      -> HTML Element: 

      1. Elements are composed of an opening tag, the content, and a closing tag. Together, they represent a complete unit of content within an HTML document.
      2. Example, the <p> element represents a paragraph of text, while the <a> element represents a hyperlink.
