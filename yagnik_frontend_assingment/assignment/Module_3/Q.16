Q.16 --> How are active links different from normal links?

Ans:-
      
      -> Normal Link:

      1. Normal links are the default appearance of hyperlinks on a web page.
      2. They are typically styled with a specific color, often blue, and are usually underlined to indicate that they are clickable.
      3. Normal links are in their default state when the web page initially loads.


      -> Active Link:

      1. Active links are used to provide immediate feedback to the user that their click has been registered and the browser is in the process of navigating to the linked content.
      2. Visual styles for active links can vary but often include changes like temporarily changing the link's color or adding a highlight to indicate the link is currently being activated.
