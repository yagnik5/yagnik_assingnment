Q.3 --> What are void elements in HTML? With Example.

Ans:- 

      In HTML, void elements, also known as self-closing elements or empty elements, are elements that do not have a closing tag. They are used to insert various types of content or elements into a web page, but they don't have any content between an opening and closing tag because they are self-contained. 
      void element is known as unpaired tag.

      Ex. <br>
          <hr>
          <img>
          <input>
          <link>
          <meta>
          <p> -> <p> is also known as unpaired tag or paired tag.

      Example Of <p>, <br> and <hr> tag:- 
                                         <p> Write a Paragraph </p>
                                         <hr>
                                         <br>
                                         <p> Write a Paragraph 1 </p>
