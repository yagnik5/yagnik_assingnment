Q.4 --> What are HTML Entities? With Example.

Ans:- 
    
     HTML entities are special codes or sequences of characters used to represent reserved characters, symbols, or special characters in HTML documents. These entities are used to ensure that the characters are displayed correctly in the browser and do not interfere with the HTML markup.

     Ex. 1. non-breaking space: &nbsp;
         2. < - less than: &lt;
         3. > - greater than: &gt;
         4. " - double quotation mark: &quot;
         

     Example of non-breaking space and double quotation mark:-

     -> non-breaking space: &nbsp;
                                                               
      <h1> Davda&nbsp;UTsav </h1>
      -> Davda Utsav

     -> double quotation mark: &quot;

      <p> &quot; Davda Utsav &quot; </p>
      -> " Davda Utsav "
