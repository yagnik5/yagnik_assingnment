Q.7 --> What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML
elements? With Example.

Ans:- 
      
      -> Id Attribute: 

      1. The id attribute is used to uniquely identify a single HTML element on a web page.
      2. Each id value must be unique within the entire HTML document. You cannot have multiple elements with the same id.
      3. It is often used when you want to target a specific element with CSS or JavaScript.
      4. It is denoted by a (#) symbol in CSS when selecting elements.

      Example:
      <h1 id="UTSAV"> DAVDA UTSAV </h1>


      -> Class Attribute:

      1. The class is an attribute that specifies one or more class names for an HTML element.
      2. The class attribute can be used on any HTML element.
      3. It is denoted by a (.) symbol in CSS when selecting elements.

      Example:
      <p class="UTSAV"> DAVDA UTSAV </p>
      <p class="UTSAV"> FRONTEND DEVELOPER </p>
